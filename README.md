This is a sample application I built. I built this for fun and non-fun things (assignment)

## Is there any hosted version of this application?
Not yet, but I'll inform you guys when I finally made it!

## Is this app secure?
NO! For me, NO! I didn't build this application with privacy in mind

## I want to hosted it, how?
Install composer and PHP (PHP >= 8.1)
and run `composer install` to run the libraries needed by the Laravel Framework
and run `php artisan migrate` to create the sqlite database and its structure
and viola! *we finally made it*
